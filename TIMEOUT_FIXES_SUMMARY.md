# 🔧 Timeout and Polling Fixes

## 🚨 **Problem Identified**
- Kadnya API polling was too aggressive (only 60 seconds total)
- Natural backend slowness was triggering emergency mode
- Users had no control over patience/timeout settings

## ✅ **Fixes Implemented**

### 1. **Improved Polling Strategy**
- **Before:** 2 attempts × 30 seconds = 60 seconds max
- **After:** 5 minutes default with adaptive intervals
- **Smart intervals:** 10s → 30s based on response patterns
- **Progressive backoff:** Longer waits for PENDING tasks

### 2. **Intelligent Error Classification**
```typescript
// Only record failures for actual backend issues
const isNaturalTimeout = errorMessage.includes('did not complete within');
const isNetworkError = errorMessage.includes('Network');
const isBackendDown = errorMessage.includes('Backend service down');

if (isBackendDown || isNetworkError) {
  this.recordBackendFailure(); // Trigger emergency mode
} else if (isNaturalTimeout) {
  // Don't trigger emergency mode for slow but working backends
}
```

### 3. **User Timeout Control**
Added patience settings:
- **🚀 Quick (2 min):** For testing and fast results
- **⏰ Normal (5 min):** Recommended balanced approach  
- **🧘 Patient (10 min):** For complex sites needing more time

### 4. **Better Progress Feedback**
- Shows elapsed time during polling
- Indicates timeout remaining
- Warns about delays without failing immediately
- Adaptive messaging based on user's patience setting

## 🎯 **How It Works Now**

### Natural Timeout Flow:
1. User selects patience level (quick/normal/patient)
2. System polls with adaptive intervals
3. Shows progress and warnings
4. If timeout occurs naturally → **No emergency mode**
5. Falls back to demo content gracefully

### Real Backend Issues:
1. Network failures → **Emergency mode activated**
2. HTTP errors → **Emergency mode activated**  
3. Service down responses → **Emergency mode activated**

## 🛡️ **Benefits**

- **Fewer false alarms:** Emergency mode only for real issues
- **Better user experience:** Control over wait time
- **Smarter polling:** Reduces server load while improving reliability
- **Graceful degradation:** Natural timeouts don't punish the system

## 🔄 **To Test the Fixes**

1. **Clear emergency mode:** Use the "Reset" button in the UI
2. **Choose patience level:** Select quick/normal/patient
3. **Try generation:** Backend should now have more time to respond
4. **Watch progress:** Better feedback during the process

## 📊 **Expected Behavior**

| Scenario | Timeout | Emergency Mode | Fallback |
|----------|---------|----------------|----------|
| Slow but working API | 2/5/10 min | ❌ No | ✅ Demo content |
| Network errors | Immediate | ✅ Yes | ✅ Demo content |
| Backend down | Immediate | ✅ Yes | ✅ Demo content |
| Natural completion | N/A | ❌ No | ✅ Real content |

The system is now much more tolerant of slow backends while still protecting users from real issues!
